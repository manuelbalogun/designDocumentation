## Project tracking

## Users & needs/problems
Identify and survey end users, business stakeholders, and subject matter experts to get their needs. Use the tables below or this [version in google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11jehH_a7HNAwWOaf_5W3wolRz1lOSHGhhyUC2JtG8fc/edit?usp=sharing) to track and prioritize them.

### Users raw & encoded needs
Scope your users' needs/problems [like this](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/falling-wrong-design-problem/) to find the root instead of solving symptoms of a deeper problem.
| User | Time/date | Verbatim | Encoded needs like [1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ici0tedx4cje718/encodingRule1.png), [2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2bo8ch7yvukqico/encodingRule2.png), & [3](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fn726cp2gjrsy91/encodingRule3%2B4.png) |

### Sorted needs
| ${mainNeed1} | ${mainNeed2} |
| --- | --- |
| **Subneed 1.1** | **Subneed 2.1** |
| Individual need 1.1.1 | Individual need 2.1.1 |
| Individual need 1.1.2 | Individual need 2.1.2 |
| **Subneed 1.2** | **Subneed 2.2** |
| Individual need 1.2.1 | Individual need 2.2.1 |

### Refined problem statement  
In which way might we enable ${user} to solve ${mainNeed1} & ${mainNeed2}, to ${userGoal} & ${businessGoal}?
