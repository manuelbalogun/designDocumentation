# Design Doc

A lean product design process in markdown that enables cross-functional teams to take an idea from napkin to scale by prioritizing learnings to produce customer-centered solutions.

## Usage

### First choose a workflow

Decide whether you want to work in the [source files](https://github.com/ryanallen/designDoc/tree/main/docs), which let you use [node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [docbits](https://github.com/ryanallen/docbits) to keep your design doc [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) and maintainable...  

or the [distribution docs](https://github.com/ryanallen/designDoc/tree/main/dist/docs) which are built from the source files and don't require a [software build process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_build).

### Next, use this template

[CLICK TO USE THIS TEMPLATE](https://github.com/ryanallen/designDoc/generate) which will make a copy of this design doc repository, or manually save the files you need from this repo (right click the links below and 'save link as').  

Don't forget to hit that ‚≠ê button <3.

### Finally, document your designs!

1. Start with [discovery](/dist/docs/discovery.md),  
2. Then [exploration](/dist/docs/exploration.md),  
3. Then [go to market](/dist/docs/goToMarket.md),  
4. Finally share out the [summarized learnings](/dist/docs/designDoc.md)
